## 🌟 About the Project

Housing is a vital aspect of student life, directly influencing academic success and overall well-being. In Kenya, students face significant challenges in finding affordable off-campus accommodation due to limited options, unreliable listings, and inefficient search methods.

**The Campus Crib Platform** addresses these issues by leveraging technology to simplify the housing search process. Students can filter listings based on location, price, distance, and room type, while real-time chat functionality bridges communication gaps with landlords.

> _"Empowering students through accessible technology, because housing should never be a hurdle to learning."_
